# Figures_Base_age_invariant_models

Figures from the paper "Base-age invariant models for predicting individual tree accumulated annual resin yield using two tapping methods in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) forests in north-western Spain", which is under review in Forest Ecology and Management.

- Figure_1.png: Distributions area of the maritime pine stands used in the study
- Figure_2.png: Statistical differences test between the resin yields of each plot. The statistical tests between groups were perform with statistical software R (R Core Team, 2022) and the “ggstatsplot” package (Patil, 2021).
- Figure_3.jpg: Statistical differences between a) the extraction methods and b) and c) the stimulant pastes according to the extraction method. The statistical tests between groups were perform with statistical software R (R Core Team, 2022) and the “ggstatsplot” package (Patil, 2021).
- Figure_4.png: Resin yields of individual grooves during the tapping season of the two methods, non-mechanized tapping method (continuous line) and mechanized circular groove method (dashed line).
- Figure_5.jpg: Accumulated resin yield during resin tapping season for both resin tapping methods, non-mechanized tapping method (graphic at the top) and mechanized circular groove method (graphic at the bottom).
- Figure_6.jpg: The left figure was the age-dependent dynamic model E3 for non-mechanized notching and the accumulated resin yield curves of187.00, 410.25, 633.50, 856.75, and 1080.00 grams at the time t of 56 days. The right figure is the Residuals vs Residuals i+1 for non-mechanized notching model E3.
- Figure_7.jpg: The left figure was the age-dependent dynamic model E4 for mechanized circular groove and the accumulated resin yield curves of 55.00, 333.75, 612.50, 891.25, and 1170.00 grams at the time t of 56 days. The right figure is the Residuals vs Residuals i+1 for mechanized circular groove model E4.
- Figure_8.jpg: Relative root mean square error (RRMSE) by lag of prediction for mechanized circular groove (circles) and non-mechanized notching (triangles).
